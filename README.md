My curriculums

Foundations
The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding. 
Professional Development will be a key supplement of this primary goal.
At the conclusion of Foundations, I will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which I can either build upon with a Specialization
or begin preparing for interviews and jobs as part of Holberton’s interview prep, Career Sprint.
