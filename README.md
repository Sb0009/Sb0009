Six of the women ‘computors’ were selected to be its first programmers. Among these six was *Betty Holberton* "Betty had an amazing logical mind, and she solved more problems in her sleep than other people did awake " - Jean J. Bartik "Look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, and work like a dog." -Betty Holberton  💞️



          I 've started  my curriculum at the Holberton School Paris, France

 I am learning Foundations
The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding. 
Professional Development will be a key supplement of this primary goal.

At the conclusion of Foundations, I will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which I can either build upon with a Specialization
or begin preparing for interviews and jobs as part of Holberton’s interview prep, Career Sprint.
