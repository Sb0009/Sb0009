- I m passionate by TECHNOLOGIES since I am 10 years ,  i decided to improve my skill sets to realize my dreams.

  I 've started  my curriculum at the Holberton School Paris, France in January 2022
 

The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding. 
  Professional Development will be a key supplement of this primary goal.

At the conclusion of Foundations, I will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which I can either build upon with a Specialization .
                                                              
                                                     


I have built WEB and WEB MOBILE projects in PHP procedural Language and PHP POO, HTML 5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery
